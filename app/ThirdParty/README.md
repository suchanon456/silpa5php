# ThirdParty Libraries

This directory contains third-party libraries and dependencies that are not part of the core Silpa5 framework.

## Current Structure

Empty - ready for future third-party integrations

## Guidelines

When adding third-party packages:

1. Keep them in separate subdirectories
2. Document the purpose and version
3. Maintain a README in each subdirectory if needed
4. Follow the original license terms

## Examples

- Payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
- Chart libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js)
- UI components (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- PDF generators
- Email services

**Note**: Most modern dependencies should be installed via Composer in the root `composer.json`, not placed here.
